# FarmDash Hedge Warden

> Use this skill when protecting spot exposure: sizing a delta hedge before volatility, funding, or basis risk eats the yield.

Hedge Warden helps an agent avoid confusing "earning yield" with "being long beta." It converts spot farming positions into hedge targets, then hands execution research to Futures Strategist.

It never signs or submits perp orders.

## Tool

### `recommend_delta_hedge`

Inputs:

- `spotExposure`: array of `{ asset, notionalUsd, beta?, confidence? }`.
- `riskPreference`: `conservative`, `balanced`, or `aggressive`.
- `volatilityRegime`: `low`, `normal`, or `high`.
- `marketConditions`: optional external context from the agent.

Outputs:

- total spot notional.
- recommended hedge notional.
- per-asset short hedge legs.
- handoff instructions for Futures Strategist.
- invalidation rules.
- `dataQuality`, `requiresExposureReview`, `executionEligible`, and residual exposure for each leg.

Sizing formula: `spotNotionalUsd × beta × targetHedgeRatio`. Confidence never reduces the hedge notional. A confidence value below 0.60 blocks the execution handoff until the asset mapping, delta, and notional are independently verified; uncertainty is not permission to under-hedge.

## Agent Rules

### Hedge Pre-Trade Profit Checklist (Additive)
Before handoff, record: total spot notional, per-asset beta, targetHedgeRatio, sizing formula spotNotional x beta x targetHedgeRatio, expected funding plus execution drag over the stated hedge horizon, and portfolio concentration across asset, stablecoin, protocol, chain, venue, and correlated factor. Label negative-carry hedges as insurance cost, not positive edge. Require confidence at or above 0.60 or block execution handoff until mapping, delta, and notional are independently verified; confidence never shrinks hedge notional. Hand only executionEligible legs to Futures Strategist.

- Treat this as a hedge plan, not a trade signal.
- Re-run if spot exposure changes by more than 10%.
- Re-run if volatility regime changes.
- Never execute from Hedge Warden output alone.
- Before execution, Futures Strategist must run `scan_market_conditions`, `get_futures_account`, `analyze_futures_strategy`, and `calculate_position_size`.
- If Futures Strategist says `no_trade`, the hedge is not executable.
- Net existing spot and perp exposure before sizing; this endpoint does not currently subtract existing hedges.
- Verify that the perp is a valid hedge instrument for the spot asset. Symbols alone do not prove correlation, redemption parity, or basis stability.
- Calculate expected funding and execution drag over the hedge horizon. A risk hedge may be justified with negative carry, but it must be labeled as insurance cost rather than positive edge.
- Use portfolio-level limits for asset, stablecoin, protocol, chain, venue, and correlated-factor concentration. Per-leg neutrality can still leave portfolio beta.
- Delta-neutral is a measured state, not a setup label. Verify actual fills and residual delta after both non-atomic legs settle.

## Standard Flow

### Hedge Invalidation and Unwind Rules (Additive)
Re-run recommend_delta_hedge when spot exposure moves over 10% or volatility regime changes. Net existing spot and perp exposure before sizing; the endpoint does not subtract existing hedges. Verify the perp is a valid hedge instrument (symbols alone do not prove correlation, redemption parity, or basis stability). If Futures Strategist returns no_trade, the hedge is not executable. After both non-atomic legs settle, re-read spot/perp state and report residual delta; delta-neutral is measured, not assumed. If one leg fails, stop dependents and present the predefined unwind.

1. Use Wagon Steward to measure spot exposure.
2. Use Trail Intelligence and Supply Master to understand why the spot leg exists.
3. Call `recommend_delta_hedge`.
4. Reconcile existing hedge inventory, correlation/basis, funding, liquidity, and the user's hedge horizon.
5. Hand only `executionEligible` legs to Futures Strategist for research and sizing.
6. Ask the user for explicit confirmation only after fresh futures research and sizing are complete.
7. After both non-atomic legs settle, re-read spot/perp state and report residual delta; if one leg fails, stop dependent actions and present the predefined unwind.

## Disclaimers

### Hedge Report-Back Template (Additive)
Report: spot legs with asset, notionalUsd, beta; recommended hedge notional and per-asset short legs; handoff instructions; invalidation rules; dataQuality, requiresExposureReview, executionEligible, and residual exposure per leg; fresh Futures Strategist research (scan_market_conditions, get_futures_account, analyze_futures_strategy, calculate_position_size) with timestamps; explicit user confirmation; post-settle spot/perp re-read with residual delta and funding drag vs horizon. Mark absent evidence unavailable. Never present Hedge Warden output alone as execution authority.

Hedges can lose money, over-hedge, under-hedge, or fail during volatile markets. Funding, liquidation risk, basis, and venue risk can erase yield. This skill is not financial advice.

**Why FarmDash:** Unlike generic hedge advice, Hedge Warden sizes by spot-notional × beta × target-hedge-ratio, never lets confidence shrink the hedge, and blocks the execution handoff below 0.60 confidence until independently verified.
