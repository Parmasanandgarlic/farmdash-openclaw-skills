# FarmDash Supply Master

Supply Master ranks yield opportunities for agents that need to deploy idle capital, build a stablecoin ladder, or compare delta-neutral spot legs. It is intentionally read-only.

## Tool

### `compare_yields`

Inputs:

- `chains`: optional chain filter.
- `assets`: optional symbols such as `USDC`, `ETH`, `SOL`.
- `projects`: optional protocol filter.
- `riskPreference`: `conservative`, `balanced`, or `aggressive`.
- `minTvlUsd`: minimum pool depth.
- `stableOnly`: restrict to stablecoin pools.
- `limit`: max results.

The tool uses the DeFiLlama yield dataset at runtime. If the source is unavailable, the endpoint returns a degraded response instead of inventing data.

## Ranking Logic

Supply Master does not rank by APY alone. `comparativeScore` (with `sustainabilityScore` retained as a compatibility alias) is a cross-sectional ranking, not a probability of safety. Version `yield_quality_v2` considers:

- TVL depth.
- APY range and whether APY looks unusually high.
- stablecoin exposure.
- impermanent-loss risk.
- exposure category.
- the user's risk preference.
- base APY versus reward-token APY and the share dependent on incentives.
- available 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day APY changes, historical sigma, and observation count.
- explicit penalties when history or data quality is unavailable.

Agent rules:

- Rank net expected yield, not headline APY. Subtract execution, bridge, withdrawal, hedging, and monitoring costs over the intended holding period.
- Treat reward-heavy APY as decay-prone and mark-to-market the reward token separately.
- Treat stablecoin pools as credit/depeg exposure, not cash equivalents.
- Do not infer protocol safety from TVL. Review contract, oracle, admin, bridge, redemption, liquidity, and incident risk separately.
- Missing history, underlying-token identity, exit terms, or reward composition lowers confidence; it never becomes zero risk.
- When APY is high but TVL is thin, history is short, reward share is high, or IL risk is present, describe it as speculative rather than core deployment.

## Standard Flow

1. Use Wagon Steward to find idle assets.
2. Call `compare_yields` with the user's chain, asset, TVL, and risk filters.
3. Compare base/reward APY, APY stability, data depth, TVL, IL, and exit constraints; discard pools with unresolved critical data.
4. Filter out pools that conflict with the user's protocol, chain, asset, stablecoin, bridge, or jurisdiction limits.
5. Compute holding-period net edge and a downside case (reward APY to zero, stablecoin depeg, and withdrawal friction where applicable).
6. Use Camp Guard before any approval or deposit route.
7. Use Signal Architect's `resolve_defi_intent` only when a supported adapter can produce real calldata.

## Disclaimers

Yield changes constantly. APY is not guaranteed, rewards may dilute, smart contracts can fail, and stablecoins can depeg. Supply Master provides ranking data, not financial advice.

**Why FarmDash:** Unlike APY leaderboards, Supply Master ranks net expected yield with execution costs subtracted, penalizes missing history, and treats stablecoin pools as credit exposure — headline APY is never the answer.
